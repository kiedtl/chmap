# TODO

Sorted in order of the chance that they'll be implemented in the next 10
years.

- new field: UTF-16 encoding
- -c should sort and deduplicate input
- an -f flag to filter output by property (e.g. `-f case=upper`)
- simplify display code
- X11/ncurses client, which an interface similar to charmap.exe
- use cross-platform regex library instead of `regex.h` (PCRE?)
